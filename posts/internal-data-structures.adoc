== Introduction ==

As programmers, we're very used to thinking about ‘the stack’ and ‘the
heap’.  But what does it really mean to have a programming language
with a stack or a heap?  What other data structures can we use as the
basis for a language, and what kind of languages do we get when we
replace these familiar structures with others?

== Abstract machines ==

To make this structure formal, we should introduce the notion of an
_abstract machine_.  An abstract machine is just a mathematical
representation… TODO

== Stack languages ==

FORTH?  No.  C!

== Tree languages ==

== Set languages ==

== Graph languages ==
