== Recursion vs Replication
In the π-calculus replication suffices to replace recursively-defined
terms.  But this is only because connections in the π-calculus are
_inherently_ recursive: a replicated term can refer to another copy of
itself by using a channel it shares with that copy.  Without this
capability, e.g. in the private π-calculus, replication does not
suffice to reproduce recursion.

== π-calculus
There are many variants of the π-calculus.  The variant discussed here
has replication and restriction.
